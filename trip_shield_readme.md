# Project overview & problem statement chosen

**Problem Statement:** *Tourist Safety & Multi-Modal Incident Response*

**Overview:** Tourism boosts the global economy üåç ‚Äî but tourists face safety risks everywhere. TripShield is a smart safety ecosystem designed to give travelers fast, reliable help when they need it most. It solves common pain points such as:

- Safety risks in unknown areas üöß
- Difficulty reaching the right emergency services üìû
- Language & cultural barriers üåê
- Poor/no network in remote areas üì°
- Slow or fragmented emergency response systems üê¢

TripShield provides an integrated solution that combines SOS alerts, real-time risk warnings, AI translation, verified local volunteers, and offline emergency fallbacks (SMS / Bluetooth Mesh / Satellite) so travelers stay safe, connected, and protected‚Äîanytime, anywhere.

# Getting started ‚Äî Step-by-step setup instructions

> The repo is structured (suggested): `/backend` (API & services), `/mobile` (React Native / Expo), `/web` (optional dashboard), `/scripts`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended) and npm / yarn
- MongoDB (local or Atlas) or Firebase project
- Expo CLI (if using React Native + Expo): `npm i -g expo-cli`
- Flutter & Dart (if you choose Flutter)
- Android Studio / Xcode (for mobile emulators)
- Firebase project (for FCM) and Twilio account (for SMS)

## Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/tripshield.git
cd tripshield
```

## Backend (Node.js / Express)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create environment file from example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and paste real credentials
```

4. Start the server (development):

```bash
npm run dev
# or
node src/index.js
```

## Mobile app (React Native - Expo)

1. Navigate to mobile folder:

```bash
cd ../mobile
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Copy environment example and configure keys (if used):

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

4. Start Expo:

```bash
expo start
```

5. Scan QR with Expo Go or run an emulator.

### Flutter alternative

If you used Flutter for the mobile client:

```bash
cd mobile_flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Web dashboard (optional)

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm start
```

# Running & testing

- Start backend and mobile app locally.
- Use the mobile app to press the SOS button and observe backend logs.
- Example: trigger SOS via curl (replace URL & payload as needed):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/sos \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"demo-user","location":{"lat":12.9716,"lng":77.5946},"message":"Help needed","mode":"online"}'
```

- Check that notifications are sent (FCM/Twilio) and that the event is recorded in the database.

## Simulating offline mode

- **SMS fallback:** Use Twilio test credentials or a Twilio sandbox to receive and inspect SMS events.
- **Bluetooth mesh:** Simulate in-development by emulating peer discovery messages in the backend.
- **Satellite fallback:** Documented integration point for satellite gateway providers ‚Äî typically requires partner hardware or paid API.

---

# Deployment

- Backend: containerize (Dockerfile) and deploy to AWS ECS / Google Cloud Run.
- Mobile: publish to App Store / Play Store (or distribute via Expo).
- Web: host on Netlify / Vercel / S3 + CloudFront.

---

# API (example endpoints)

- `POST /api/v1/sos` ‚Äî Trigger SOS
- `GET /api/v1/alerts` ‚Äî Fetch active risk alerts
- `POST /api/v1/translate` ‚Äî Request machine translation
- `POST /api/v1/volunteer/register` ‚Äî Register as a verified volunteer

(Provide full API docs in `/docs` or use Swagger/OpenAPI file.)

# Security & privacy notes

- Personal data and location are highly sensitive ‚Äî store only what‚Äôs necessary and follow GDPR/local laws.
- Use TLS/HTTPS everywhere, secure credentials, and rotate API keys periodically.
- Verify volunteers using KYC checks or a trust-verification workflow before dispatching them in real incidents.
